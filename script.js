//Sample Code ideas to use for tracking Figurines.

//The MasterFigure Object is a single Object that is used as a template for creating more Objects per Unit
  /*
    let masterFigure = {
      name: "",
      quantity: null,
      gear: [],
      stats: [],
      cost: null,
      paint_scheme: []
    };
  */
  
  //name is for the name of the figurine
  //quantity is for how many figurines of that model a user has
  //gear is an array for tracking each piece of gear (as an object with name/cost/stats/etc)
  //stats is for tracking each stat on a unit (ex. WS,BS,S,T,etc)
  //cost is the total points cost for a given model after factoring in how many and it's gear
  //paint_scheme is used to track which paints were used where and how much paint was appplied
